# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

a) Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: 

    1. What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    For this project, I was tasked with training an Intelligent Agent to navigate a maze to find hidden treasure. Most of the code was given including the environment, the Experience for Replay, the building of the neural network model, and the play game. The code I created myself was the Q-Training Algorithm.

b) Connect your learning throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  1. What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
 
      Computer scientists design and develops programs, software, and algorithm that help solve certain problems. This is important because the program, etc that we create help make life easier for those who use them. Today, Software and programs are integrated into our very society.
  
  2. How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  
       As a Computer scientist, I approach a problem by first analyzing it. Each problem requires a different solution so after I have an understanding of the problem I begin coming up with a plan in the form of a flowchart or pseudocode. Once I have a plan I can begin coding, making sure I test the code as I go.
  
  3. What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  
      My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to make sure any code I produce follows legal guidelines to protect the organization. This includes only using the user's information that is needed, making sure that information is only being used legally, and making sure the user's information is secure.
