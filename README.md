# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

a) Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project i was tasked with training an Intelligient Agent to navigate a maze to find hiddent treasue.Most of the code was given including the Enviorment, the Experience for Replay, building of the neural network model and the play game. The code I created myself was the Q-Training Algorithm.

b) Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  1) What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
      Computer scientists design and develops programs, software and algorithm that help solve certain problems. This is important because the program, etc that we create help make life easier for those who use them. Today, Software and programs are intergrate into our very society.
  
  2)How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
       As a Computer scientist, i approach a problem by first anylazing it. Each problem requires a diffrent solution so after i have an understanding of the problem i begin comeing up with a plan in the form of a flowchart or psudeocode.
  
  3)What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
      My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to make sure any code I produce follows legal guidelines to protect organization. This         includes only useing user's information that is needed, makeing sure that information is only being use legally and makeing sure the user's information is secure.
